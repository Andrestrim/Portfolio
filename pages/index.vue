          Hey there! My name is Andr√© Figueiredo, I have a BS in information
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started studying and creating my own projects since March 2022, and
          since then, I feel more and more inspired and willing to pursue my
          career in the area as a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>My current goal is to kickstart my career and get my first job.</p>
        <p>
          My main technologies are Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Nuxt.js,
          Adonis.js and Node.js.
        </p>
